The project aims to work with [Java Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)) technology (tasks in the project in Russian).  
The project contains the solution of such tasks as:
  * Demonstration of class content on an object of type [Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html)  
  * Retrieving data about class contents by a passed object of some class  
  * Creating an object using reflection and calling a method on this object  
  * Creation of arrays and matrices during program operation with the possibility of changing dimensions  
  * Demonstration of the use of [dynamic proxy](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/reflection/proxy.html) objects
